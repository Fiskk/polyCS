  <h3>Account Activation Procedure</h3>
  <p>Activated Computer Science accounts are required in order to log in to CS labs
    and services.  CS accounts
  are available to anyone on campus, regardless of major.
  </p>

  <p>All new users must activate their Computer Science Department accounts
  by connecting to <a href="https://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/">https://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/</a>
  and selecting Activate a Login Account.
  After following these steps your account is typically available within 5 minutes.</p>

  <h3>Passwords</h3>
  <p>
  Once activated, your CS and campus login accounts will be maintained separately.
  A password change or reset to one will not result in a change to the other.
