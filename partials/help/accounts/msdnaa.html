    The Computer Science department subscribes to the Microsoft Developer Network Academic
    Alliance program.  This program allows all enrolled students access to almost all of the
    software Microsoft offers for sale.  The software available can either be downloaded from this site:
    <a href="http://msdn.cs.sunyit.edu">http://msdn.cs.sunyit.edu</a>
    or, for certain titles, a copy can be burned directly in the Kunsela C014 lab.

  <br /><br />

  <p>Three things to take note of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You must have an
      <a href="http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/activate.php">activated CS account</a>
      in order to log in to the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <!-- Per the <a href="http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/msdn-agree.php">Student Use Agreement</a> -->
      Per the <a href="#msdnaa-agree">Student Use Agreement</a>
      from Microsoft, you must be taking at least 1 course offered by the Computer Science
      department in order to be eligible to download software. If your academic major is
      not listed as CS or CIS, you may be prompted for more information in order to
      determine eligibility.
    <li>
      Microsoft controls the web site.  When you log in, they will receive your SUNY Polytechnic username.
      They may collect other information from you when you select software to download.
  </ul>
