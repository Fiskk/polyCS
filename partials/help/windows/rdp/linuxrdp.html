    Remmina is a Linux GUI program used for connecting to various remote protocols,
    such as RDP, VNC, and SSH. Remmina can be installed from most distributions' package
    manager. It also requires a GTK+ 3 compatible GUI, like MATE, Gnome 3, or KDE. If your
    GUI is not compatible, Remmina will install the GUI extensions as well.
  </p>

  <h4>Debian-Based systems</h4>

  <p>
    Remmina can be installed using apt, with the command <font color='fuchsia'>apt-get install remmina</font>.
  </p>

  <h4>Red Hat-Based systems</h4>
  <p>
    Remmina can be installed using yum, with the command <font color='fuchsia'>yum install remmina</font>
    . Remmina may not be availible in the base CentOS 6 packages, so the use of the EPEL packages
    may be required. These can be installed by running <font color='fuchsia'>yum install epel-release</font>
  </p>

  <h4>From Source</h4>
  <p>
    The FreeRDP Project maintains Remmina both on <a href="https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina">Github</a>
    and on <a href="http://www.remmina.org/wp/">Remmina's Official Website</a>. Follow the instructions
    there for building Remmina from source. Remember that a GTK+ 3 GUI is needed to run Remmina.

    system with default settings.Make sure that the RDP protocol is selected, as the Multipoint server
