    <p class="hint">
      If you are using Linux or OSx,
      you can use an application such <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>
      . Filezilla is available in many repositories and can likely be downloaded via your package
      manager, or you can use the link above to download the client directly from the website.

  <P>The Computer Science department long since phased out use of insecure telnet
  and FTP protocols, replacing them with secure alternatives.
 </P>

  <p>WinSCP is a free, open source SFTP client for Windows. Legacy SCP protocol is also supported.
  Its main function is safe copying of files between a local and a remote computer.
  </p>

    After installing WinSCP, follow the steps below to connect to your files securely
