  <p>The Windows roaming user profiles on the CS Network allow you to have
    a personalized desktop environment.  You are able to customize your
    desktop, icons, and program settings and have these setting follow you
    to each Windows machine on the CS network.
    A default profile is generated for new users on their first login. </p>

  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>When you log in to a Windows machine for the first time, your profile is
  created based on the Default profile.  Any changes you make are then saved
  to your profile.</p>
  <p>Your profile is stored on the CS samba server.  Each time you log in to a
  windows machine, this profile is transfered from the server to the local
  computer and stored under C:\Documents and Setting\username\.  When you log out
  your profile, along with any changes you have made, is then transfered back to the
  server and deleted from the local machine.
  </p>

  <h3>Profile Size</h3>

  <p>If your windows profile becomes too large or corrupt, you may have trouble
  logging in to the Windows machines or running programs.</p>

  <p>A size greater then 15-25mb is excessive and will result in a long wait each
  time you log on/off of a windows machine.  The most common problem is the storage of
  large files on the desktop and the cache directories of internet browsers.</p>

  <p>To reduce the size of your profile, either clean it up or reset it.  Removing
  large files from the desktop may be a good place to start.</p>

  <h3>Resetting a corrupt windows profile:</h3>


  <p>Your windows profile is stored on the samba server and can only be accessed
  by an administrator.  Occasionally, a windows profile will become corrupt and
  need to be reset.  If you would like your profile reset stop by our
  workroom in C107 or
