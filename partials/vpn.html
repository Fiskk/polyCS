    A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network (in this case, the CS-Department's network)
    over the Internet. Using a VPN allows a user to securely access the necessary information within
    a private network over the Internet as if they never left the initial network.

    1. Before beginning, you must have an activated CS account. If you don't
    have one, you can sign up for one at
    <a href="http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/activate.php">http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/activate.php</a>.

    2. Next, you'll need a VPN client. For this tutorial, we assume that you are using
    OpenVPN, but the process will be similar with other clients as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Windows users and OSx users can download OpenVPN's installer
    at <a href="https://openvpn.net/"> https://openvpn.net/</a>
    Users of Debian-based Linux distros will have the command-line client installed
    by default. If your linux distro lacks OpenVPN, you can grab a tarball of the source at
    <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html">
      https://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html
    </a>
  </p>

  <img class="img-responsive center" src='img/help/vpn/openvpninstaller.PNG' alt="Windows File Explorer">
  <p>
    To install OpenVPN, Windows or OSx users can run their respective installer-files and click
    through their respective wizards. Linux users will have to configure their client via
    command-line. A good tutorial is available over at
    <a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/configure-linux-clients-connect-openvpn-server">
      Linux.com
    </a>

    3. You're also going to need to download some files that are available
    <a href="https://github.com/derekbaker1986/VPN">here</a>. Extract the files.
    You'll need them later.
  </p>

  <p>
    4. Launch OpenVPN. At this point, Linux users will have to refer once again to
    <a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/configure-linux-clients-connect-openvpn-server">Linux.com</a>
    since the remainder of this tutorial only demonstrates use of the the GUI version of this
    software.
