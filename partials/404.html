<h1>Roundcube is down for maintenance</h1>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience and expect service to be restored shortly.</p>

<p>
    You may be able to use the Alpine application from Fang to check your mail, 
    or you can modify the .forward file in your home directory to forward your mail to another account. 
    If you attempt to use Alpine, and get an error related to storage, see below.

<p>
    We are also currently experiencing a storage shortage on our NFS. 
    Please delete any old/unnecessary files from your home-directories on Fang.
