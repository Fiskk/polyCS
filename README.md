# polyCS

- SUNY Polytechnic Computer Science Department website. 

- Built with Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS 1.x, and AngularUI. 

- The repo contains all the necessary dependencies to run the client-side stuff, so simply cloning the repo should get you up and running since Angular is served locally instead of from a CDN.

- If you prefer to throw together a more proper dev environment, but you're lazy like me, <a href="https://github.com/bylexus/docker-apache-php53/blob/master/Dockerfile">this Docker container</a> comes with Apache and PHP 5.3, which is essentially what we're running at present (albeit on FreeBSD instead of Ubuntu).

- There are several open issues that could be resolved, so don't be shy about making a
  pull request!
  
- Refactors or design tweaks are encouraged.
  
- If you have questions, feel free to ask: bakerdp@sunyit.edu.   

- The Master Branch usually sees at least one commit per day, so make sure you keep your local branch up to date.

- Note: using non-minified version of Angular will allow you to see complete error messages
