<h1>Help: Activate your account</h1>

<div id='content'>
<h3>Account Activation Procedure</h3>
<p>Activated Computer Science accounts are required in order to log in to CS labs and services.  CS accounts
are available to anyone on campus, regardless of major.
</p>

<p>All new users must activate their Computer Science Department accounts
by connecting to <a href="https://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/">https://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/</a> and selecting Activate a Login Account.
After following these steps your account is typically available within 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Passwords</h3>
<p>
Once activated, your CS and campus login accounts will be maintained separately.
A password change or reset to one will not result in a change to the other.
