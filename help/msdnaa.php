<h3>Microsoft Developer Network Academic Alliance (MSDNAA)</h3>

<p>
The Computer Science department subscribes to the Microsoft Developer Network Academic
Alliance program.  This program allows all enrolled students access to almost all of the
software Microsoft offers for sale.  The software available can either be downloaded from this site:
<a href="http://msdn.cs.sunyit.edu">http://msdn.cs.sunyit.edu</a>
or, for certain titles, a copy can be burned directly in the Kunsela C014 lab.
</p>

<p>
In the past, access to the site was controlled by a username based on your email address and a password
issued by Microsoft.  Beginning June 2005, the username and password for the MSDN downloads site is the
same as your login username and password to the Computer Science labs and servers.

Three things to take note of:</p>
<UL type=circle>
<LI>You must have an <a href="http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/activate.php">activated CS account</a> in order to log in to the site.
<LI>Per the <a href="http://accounts.cs.sunyit.edu/msdn-agree.php">Student Use Agreement</a> from Microsoft, you must be taking at least 1 course
offered by the Computer Science department in order to be eligible to download software.  If your academic major is not listed as
CS or CIS, you may be prompted for more information in order to determine eligibility.
<LI>Microsoft controls the web site.  When you log in, they will receive your SUNYIT username.  They may collect other information
from you when you select software to download.
