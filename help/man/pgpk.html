<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pgpk</B> Manages public and	private  keys  for  PGP.   Unlike
       other  PGP applications, pgpk is stream based and not file
       based; if no files are specified,  <I>stdin</I>  and  <I>stdout</I>  are
       used.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       All  configuration options can be controlled from the com-
       mand line.  See <B>pgp.cfg(5)</B> for a complete list and how  to
       specify them.


       -a [keyfile]
	      Adds  the  contents of <I>keyfile</I> to your keyring.  If
	      <I>keyfile</I> is  not  specified,  input  is  taken  from
	      <I>stdin.</I>   <I>Keyfile</I>	may also be an URL; the supported
	      protocols are <B>hkp</B> (Horowitz Key Protocol), <B>http</B> and
	      <B>finger</B>.	To  add  <B>foo@bar.baz.com</B>'s  key  to  your
	      keyring from PGP, Inc's server, for example, enter:

	      <I>pgpk</I> <I>-a</I> <I>hkp://keys.pgp.com/foo@bar.baz.com</I>

	      If <B>foo@bar.baz.com</B> has his key in his finger infor-
	      mation, you could add that with:

	      <I>pgpk</I> <I>-a</I> <I>finger://bar.baz.com/foo</I>

	      If <B>foo@bar.baz.com</B> has his key on his web page, you
	      could add that with:

	      <I>pgpk</I> <I>-a</I> <I>http://www.baz.com/foo/DSSkey.html</I>

	      If  the  <I>Keyfile</I>	is  not  obviously a filename (it
	      doesn't begin with "/"  or  "./")  and  it  doesn't
	      exist  as  a readable file, an attempt will be made
	      to fetch it from your default keyserver  using  the
	      <B>Horowitz</B>	<B>Key</B> <B>Protocol</B>.  (See <B>pgp.cfg(5)</B> for infor-
	      mation on setting  your  default	keyserver).   For
	      example,	if there is no file named <I>foo@bar.baz.com</I>
	      readable in the current directory,

	      <I>pgpk</I> <I>-a</I> <I>foo@bar.baz.com</I>

	      security risk (as it could potentially leak  infor-
	      mation about the files on your system if you make a
	      typing error).  Use the <B>GetNotFoundKeyFiles</B> config-
	      uration option to disable this behavior.

       -c [userid]
	      Checks  the  signatures  of all keys on your public
	      keyring.	If <B>[userid]</B> is specified, only the signa-
	      tures  on  that key are checked.	This command per-
	      forms <I>pgpk</I> <I>-ll</I> on all specified keys, then  outputs
	      an  explicit listing of trust and validity for each
	      key.  <B>Trust</B> is the amount of trust placed  in  each
	      key  as  an  introducer.	<B>Validity</B> is the certainty
	      that the key and user  ID  belong  together.   Both
	      this command and the long listing function output a
	      leading column which succinctly describes the  con-
	      dition of the key.

	      The possible leading columns can have the following
	      first three character values:

	      <B>pub</B> A public key
	      <B>ret</B> A revoked key
	      <B>sec</B> A secret key
	      <B>sub</B> A sub-key (in 5.0, this  is  always  a  Diffie-
	      Hellman key)
	      <B>SIG</B> A signature issued by a public key to which you
	      have thecorresponding private key (i.e., your key)
	      <B>sig</B> A signature issued by a public key to which you
	      do  NOT  have  the corresponding private key (i.e.,
	      someone else's key)
	      <B>uid</B> A user ID

	      Following this column is a single  character  which
	      describes other attributes of the object:

	      <B>%</B>  The object is not valid (it does not have enough
	      trusted signatures)
	      <B>?</B>  No information is  available  about  the  object
	      (generally  because  it  is  a signature from a key
	      that is not on your keyring)
	      <B>!</B>  The object has been checked
	      <B>*</B> The object has been tried
	      <B>@</B> The object is disabled
	      <B>+</B> The object is axiomatically trusted  (i.e.,  it's
	      your key)

       -d &lt;userid&gt;
	      Toggles  the  disablement of <B>&lt;userid&gt;</B>'s key on your
	      public keyring.

       -e &lt;userid&gt;
	      If it is someone else's key, it allows you to  edit
	      the trust you have in that person as an introducer.

       -g     Generate a public/private key pair.

       -l[l] [userid]
	      Lists information about  a  key.	 <B>-ll</B>  lists  more
	      information about a key.	If <B>[userid]</B> is specified,
	      that  key  is  listed.   Otherwise,  all	keys  are
	      listed.	See <B>-c</B>, above, for more information about
	      the long format.

       -o outfile
	      Specifies that output should go to <I>outfile</I>.  If not
	      specified,  output  goes	to <I>stdout</I>.  If the output
	      file is from a key extraction (see <B>-x</B>, below),  you
	      may  specify  an	hkp  (Horowitz Key Protocol) URL.
	      For   example:   <I>pgpk</I>   <I>-x</I>    <I>foo@bar.baz.com</I>    <I>-o</I>
	      <I>hkp://keys.pgp.com</I> would send <B>foo@bar.baz.com</B>'s key
	      to the PGP, Inc. public key server.

       --revoke &lt;userid&gt;
	      <B>Permanately</B> revokes the key specified.  There is no
	      way  to  undo  this,  so	don't play with it if you
	      don't mean it.

       --revokes &lt;userid&gt;
	      <B>Permanently</B> revokes your signature (if any) on  the
	      key specified.

       -r &lt;userid&gt;
	      Removes  <B>&lt;userid&gt;</B>'s  key	from your public keyring,
	      and your private as well, if it's there.

       -ru &lt;userid&gt;
	      Removes the given userid from your public and  pri-
	      vate keyrings.

       -rs &lt;userid&gt;
	      Removes	the  given  signature  from  your  public
	      keyring.

       -s &lt;userid&gt; [-u &lt;yourid&gt;]
	      Signs <B>&lt;userid&gt;</B>'s key with your default signing key.
	      If <B>-u</B> is specified, uses that key, instead.

       -x &lt;userid&gt;
	      Extracts	the  specified key in ASCII-armored form.
	      <B>-x</B> <B>&lt;userid&gt;</B>

       -z     Batch mode.  See <B>pgp-integration(7)</B> for  a  discus-
	      sion  of integrating pgp support into your applica-
       <I>pgpk</I> <I>-g</I> Generates a key.
