<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>

       pgp.cfg - Format of the configuration file used by <B>pgp(1)</B>.

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The default location for this file  is  ~/.pgp.	 You  may
       specify	another location by setting the environment vari-
       able  <I>PGPPATH</I>.	SH  COMMAND-LINE  SPECIFICATION  All  PGP
       applications  accept  these  options as command-line argu-
       ments, as well.	Command line  arguments  always  override
       the configuration file.	Options are specified with a dou-
       ble-dash (--) or plus (+), followed by an equal	sign  (=)
       and  the  value,  if appropriate.  For example, to specify
       the public keyring to use on an encryption operation:

       <I>pgpe</I> <I>-r</I> <I>foo@bar.baz.com</I> <I>--pubring=~/fooring.pkr</I>

       To turn on text mode, in an encryption:

       <I>pgpe</I> <I>-r</I> <I>foo@bar.baz.com</I> <I>--textmode</I>


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following configuration options are supported, both in
       the  <I>pgp.cfg</I>  file and on the command line of PGP applica-
       tions.  Case is not important in specifying  the  variable
       names,  but  may  be in specifying filenames, depending on
       your operating environment.   Immediately  following  each
       option  is  a  description of its type:	Boolean is either
       "1" or "on" or "0" or "off"; String is a string; and Inte-
       ger is a number.

       Armor  Boolean.	 Turns	ASCII  armoring  on  or off.  The
	      default is off.

       ArmorLines
	      Integer.	Specifies the  maximum	number	of  lines
	      that  may be contained in an ASCII armored message.
	      Messages longer than this number of lines  will  be
	      broken  up  into multi-part ASCII armored messages.
	      A value of zero indicates an  unlimited  number  of
	      lines.  The default is zero.

       AutoServerFetch
	      Boolean.	 If on, when adding keys with <B>pgpk(1)</B>, if
	      a specified key file is not found, it is assumed to
	      be  the name of a key to retrieve from your default
	      key  server  (see  <I>HTTPKeyServerHost</I>  and  <I>HTTPKey-</I>
	      <I>ServerPort</I>,    below).	 Some	intelligence   is
	      attempted; even if this is on, if it is  obvious	a
	      file  was  intended  (if	the  first characters are
	      either "/" or "./"), a fetch will not be made.  The
	      default is on.

       Compress

       EncryptToSelf
	      Boolean.	 If  on,  automatically encrypts all mes-
	      sages to your  default  key,  as	well  as  to  the
	      intended	recipient.  Intended to allow you to read
	      encrypted mail you've sent.  The default is off.

       FastKeyGen
	      Boolean.	Utilizes pre-generated prime numbers  for
	      certain  initial	operations  on DSS/Diffie-Hellman
	      key generation.  This only works for "standard" key
	      sizes  (1024,  1596  and 2048).  The default is on.
	      To turn this off, use: <I>pgpk</I> <I>+fastkeygen=0</I> <I>-g</I>

       HTTPKeyServerHost
	      String.  The name of a keyserver to use in  default
	      lookups  (see <I>AutoServerFetch</I>, above).  The default
	      is pgpkeys.mit.edu.

       HTTPKeyServerPort
	      Integer.	The port to use for  connections  to  the
	      default  key  server as specified in <I>HTTPKeyServer-</I>
	      <I>Host</I>, above.  The default  is  11371,  the  default
	      port for the Horowitz Key Protocol.

       Language
	      String.	The country code of the language you wish
	      to use.  The default is "us."

       LanguageFile
	      String.	The  file  from  which	to  load  runtime
	      strings.	 The  default is "language50.txt" in your
	      .pgp directory.  If this file does not  exist,  PGP
	      will use internal defaults.

       MyName String.	The  key  ID  you  wish to be default for
	      signing operations and  the  <I>EncryptToSelf</I>  option,
	      above.   There  is  no default; however, if none is
	      specified, the first  secret  key  on  your  secret
	      keyring will be used for most operations.

       NoBatchInvalidKeys
	      Boolean.	If True, batch mode will fail if the user
	      attempts to encrypt to a key that is invalid or not
	      completely  valid.   If  false, batch mode will use
	      invalid keys.  Note that this option  only  applies
	      to  batch  mode; normally, PGP will ask the user to
	      confirm prior to encrypting to in an  invalid  key.
	      The default is on.

       PubRing
	      String.	Your public keyring file.  The default is
	      String.  Entropy-generating device.  If present, it
	      will  be	used in favor of asking the user for key-
	      board input.  The default is "/dev/random."

       SecRing
	      String.  Your secret keyring file.  The default  is
	      "secring.skr" in your .pgp directory.

       WarnOnMixRSADiffieHellman
	      Boolean.	 Warns the user if encrypting to multiple
	      keys, one or more of which is RSA and one  or  more
	      of  which  is  DSS/Diffie-Hellman.   The reason for
	      this warning is that most RSA key owners will still
	      be  using  2.6.2,  which	will not properly decrypt
	      such messages.  The default is on.

       WarnOnRSARecipAndNonRSASigner
	      Boolean.	Warns the user if encrypting  to  an  RSA
	      key,  but  signing  with	a DSS/Diffie-Hellman key.
	      The reason for this warning is that  most  RSA  key
	      owners  will  still  be using 2.6.2, which will not
	      properly decrypt such messages.  The default is on.
