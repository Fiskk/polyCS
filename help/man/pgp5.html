<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>

       PGP - A suite of tools for encrypting, decrypting and ver-
       ifying messages.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       There are two files in this  package,  but  several  addi-
       tional  modes  of  operation  are  available  via symbolic
       links:

	      <B>pgp(1)</B> is the main cryptographic engine of the  PGP
	      package.	 However,  invoking  it  as itself merely
	      prints a usage summary.

	      <B>pgpe(1)</B> is executed  to  encrypt,  or  encrypt  and
	      sign, files.  It is a link to <B>pgp(1)</B>.

	      <B>pgps(1)</B>  is  executed  to only sign files.  It is a
	      link to <B>pgp(1)</B>.

	      <B>pgpv(1)</B> is  executed  to	only  verify  or  decrypt
	      signed or encrypted files.  It is a link to <B>pgp(1)</B>.

	      <B>pgpk(1)</B> is the key management application, which is
	      used  to	generate, retrieve and send keys, as well
	      as manage trust.

       Public key cryptography must be fully  understood  by  the
       user to be useful.  A successful PGP user must be familiar
       with public key cryptography in general, and some PGP-spe-
       cific  concepts	(such  as the web of trust).  If you feel
       comfortable with your own level of knowledge on this  sub-
       ject,  your  first  step is probably going to be to invoke
       <B>pgpk(1)</B> to generate a key.  Additionally, a page  by  Phil
       Zimmermann  on  the importance of cryptography is included
       in <B>pgp-intro(7)</B>.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>~/.pgp/pgp.cfg</I>
	      User-specific  configuration  file.   In	 previous
	      releases,  this  file  was  called <I>config.txt</I>.  See
	      <B>pgp.cfg(5)</B> for further details.


</PRE>
<H2>MIGRATION</H2><PRE>
       Users migrating from earlier versions of PGP will need  to
       manually migrate the following configuration files:

	      <I>~/.pgp/config.txt</I> is now <I>~/.pgp/pgp.cfg</I>.	This file
	      may be copied manually.  If  not	copied,  internal
	      defaults	will  be  used.   This	file  is  largely
	      unchanged in 5.0.  See <B>pgp.cfg(5)</B> for more informa-
	      tion on this file.

	      <I>~/.pgp/pubring.pgp</I>  is now <I>~/.pgp/pubring.pkr</I>.  You

	      <I>~/.pgp/secring.pgp</I>  is now <I>~/.pgp/secring.skr</I>.  You
	      may copy your old private keyring.  Even if you  do
	      this,   you   are  encouraged  to  generate  a  new
	      DSS/Diffie-Hellman key to allow communication  with
	      all 5.0 users.

	      <I>~/.pgp/language.txt</I>  is  now <I>~/.pgp/language50.txt</I>.
	      This file should <B>not</B> be copied from  your  previous
	      installation, as it is completely different in 5.0.
	      If this file is not present, internal defaults will
	      be used.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Keyserver support should be more informative with  unknown
       protocols.

       URL parsing uses static buffers and is vulnerable to over-
       flow attacks.

       The PAGER directive in pgp.cfg doesn't work.

       The -b option to <B>pgpv(1)</B> is not implemented.  This  option
       allowed	the  "breaking"  of signed files into a signature
       and a file (effectively,  a  retroactive  detached  signa-
       ture).

       <B>pgpv</B>  <B>-m</B>  ("more"  mode) and "eyes-only" decryption is not
       displaying properly.  It is suggested that your	pipe  the
       output of <B>pgpv(1)</B> into your pager of preference until this
       is fixed.

       <B>pgpk(1)</B> doesn't pay attention  to  the  <B>+force</B>  option  to
       force file overwrite; it stops to ask for confirmation.

       Multipart  armoring  doesn't  handle all possible permuta-
       tions - specifically, it does not work properly if all the

       There is currently no way to specify just a secret or pub-
       lic keyring for an operation.

       <B>pgp</B>  <B>--version</B> doesn't work.  Use <B>pgpk</B> <B>--version</B> or one of
       the other commands, instead.

       <B>pgpv</B> <B>-p</B>, to "preserve" the original input filename, is not
       yet supported.

       There  are a number of bugs when specifying filenames end-
       ing in digits; the general result is that the default out-
       put filename is not what might be expected (i.e., <B>pgpe</B> <B>-sa</B>
       <B>foo1</B> results in an output suggestion of <I>foo1.asc.1</I> instead
       of  <I>foo1.asc</I>,  as  expected).   It is conjectured that the
       user interface is becoming confused and invoking the rules
       used to generate multi-part ASCII armor filenames.

       Configuration  option  <I>TZfix</I> doesn't allow specifying non-
       mainstream values, such as <B>-420</B> or <B>30</B>.

       <B>pgpk</B> <B>-e</B> does not ask about marking a new  userid  as  pri-
       mary.

       <B>pgpk</B> <B>-a</B> should accept a key on stdin, but does not.

       <B>pgpk</B>  is,  in  some instances, overwriting the "previously
       encrypted to invalid key" flag on some keys.
